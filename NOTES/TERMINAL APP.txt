You need to navigate to the project folder first! The # lines are just comments - don't copy those.
Here's what to do:

powershell

type this on its own to run prog:
npm run dev

directory:
cd Desktop\k11-payment-app-2








Or the full path:
powershell

cd C:\Users\alecb\Desktop\k11-payment-app-2
npm start
